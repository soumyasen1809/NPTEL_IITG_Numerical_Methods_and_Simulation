The course contains very important aspects of modern day course curriculum, namely, numerical methods and simulation techniques that are going to be of utmost importance to both undergraduate and graduate level. Most of the real life problems are unsolvable using known analytic techniques, thus depending on numerical methods is imperative. The course introduces basic numerical methods and the key simulation techniques that are going to be useful to academia and industry alike. Even if the software packages, such as Mathematica, Matlab etc are available for most of the numeric computations, yet one should be aware of the techniques that are inbuilt into the softwares.
